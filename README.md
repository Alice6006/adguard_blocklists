AdGuard

My version of this blocklist is for the samsung tv only, I copied it from Dandelion Sprout he has a blocklist for multiple tv's, and I only needed the samsung.
Shoutout to Dandelion Sprout for giving us this list and I will put the original in here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Perflyst/PiHoleBlocklist/master/SmartTV-AGH.txt

So you can use the copied list from me (for the samsung only) or pick a tv from the list from Dandelion Sprout at your choice (or all of them). Enjoy the list!

I'll try to update the list as soon as the other list will be updated.

For my list in adguard/pihole add: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alice6006/adguard_blocklists/main/Samsung-TV_Blocklist.txt

If you've any extra for the blocklist that I forgot, please send me a message with the links and I'll mention you as contributer.
